## The following are my notes when practice USACO training.

* [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/cj9208/USACO/blob/master/DP.md)
* Greedy algorithms
* Complete Search
    * remove unnecessary search (simple check)
    * find efficient way to search
    * DFS / BFS(queue)
    * bit operation
* Flood Fill
* Shortest Path
* Recursive Search Techniques
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Knapsack
* Computational Geometry
* Network Flow
* Eulerian Path
* Two-Dimensional Convex Hull
* BigNums
* Heuristic Search
* Approximate Search
* Ad Hoc Problems
