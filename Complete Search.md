# Complete Search
## Principle
* Keep It Simple, Stupid
* Exploit the brute force, straight-forward, try-them-all method of finding the answer

## Common Algorithms
* DFS (use recursive way to program)
* BFS 
  * use a queue to record the nodes to be visited
  * can be used to find the shortest path
  * Need much space
* DFS + ID (run D depth first searches first, then BFS)

## Optimization
* remove unnecessary search (simple check)
* find efficient way to search
* bit operation(save space & accelerate judge procedure)
