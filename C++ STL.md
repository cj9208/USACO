# C++ Standard Template Library
* Three well-structrued components :
    * Containers : eg. deque, list, vector, map
    * Algorithms : eg. perform initialization, sorting, searching, and transforming of the contents of containers
    * iterators : used to step through the elements of collections of objects

(how they are implemented, good/bad/properties)
(to be finished)
* Sequence Containers
    * vector
    * list
* Associated Containers
    * map, multimap
    * set, multiset
* Container Adapters
    * stack
    * queue
    * priority_queue
* algorithm
    * sort
    * min/max
